## Questions Answered
Does a particular stock move indepently of the market?  
Plots comparing the percent change to the SP500 and percent changed normalized by the SP500 are present in the dashboar.  
Should you buy?  
A plot of price and volume slope are presented in order to help make that decision. If the volume of trading goes down, then one would not expect the price to rise.
